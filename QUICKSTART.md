# Fox Run Task Tracker - Quick Start Guide

Get your family productivity system up and running in 10 minutes!

## üéØ What You'll Get

After this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ Local development environment running
- ‚úÖ Access to the production system at https://foxruntasks.netlify.app
- ‚úÖ Understanding of how to use all features
- ‚úÖ Knowledge of how to deploy updates

## üåê Using the Production System (Fastest Start)

**Already deployed and running!**

1. Visit: **https://foxruntasks.netlify.app**
2. Log in with your access code (ask admin for your code)
3. Start creating tasks, events, and using all features

That's it! The system is live and ready to use.

## üíª Local Development Setup

Want to develop locally or understand how it works? Follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Python 3.12+ (`python3 --version`)
- [ ] Node.js 18+ (`node --version`)
- [ ] Anthropic API key (optional, for AI features)
- [ ] Git installed

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2dbatkv/foxrun-taskapp.git
cd foxrun-taskapp
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
USE_JSON_STORAGE=true
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here_optional
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
EOF
```

**Note:** If you don't have an Anthropic API key, AI features won't work but everything else will!

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (1 minute)

```bash
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
```

### Step 4: Start the System (1 minute)

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Wait for: `Application startup complete.`

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

## üöÄ Access Your Local System

Open your browser to:
- **App**: http://localhost:5173
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## üîê Login

The system uses access codes instead of usernames/passwords. On first run, 6 default codes are created:

**Default Access Codes:**
- Admin codes: `9566RFB`, `9553AJB` (full system access)
- Member codes: `9127SAM`, `1112ZBB`, `7226TBB`, `9807AUR`

*Note: These can be viewed in the Admin panel by logging in with an admin code.*

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# View logs in real-time
tail -f logs/app.log

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Frontend

# Start development server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find what's using port 8000
lsof -i :8000

# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Access Code Not Working
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after the code
- Codes are case-sensitive
- Check Admin panel Login Activity for failure reason

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
- Ensure backend is running (`http://localhost:8000/health` should work)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `.env` has correct `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

### Data Not Saving
- Check that `data/` directory exists in backend folder
- Ensure write permissions on `data/` directory
- Check backend logs for errors

### AI Features Not Working
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in backend `.env`
- Check API key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/
- Review backend logs for API errors

## üö¢ Deploying Your Changes

### To Production (Render + Netlify)

Changes deploy automatically when pushed to GitHub:

```bash
# Make your changes to code
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. GitHub receives your push
2. Netlify rebuilds frontend (2-3 minutes)
3. Render rebuilds backend (2-3 minutes)
4. Changes go live at https://foxruntasks.netlify.app

### Verify Deployment

**Backend:**
```bash
curl https://fox-run-task-planner.onrender.com/health
```

**Frontend:**
Visit https://foxruntasks.netlify.app and test features

## üìä Understanding the Data

All data is stored in JSON files in the `backend/data/` directory:

- `access_codes.json` - Authentication codes (hashed)
- `login_attempts.json` - Audit trail of all logins
- `tasks.json` - All task data
- `calendar.json` - Calendar events
- `reminders.json` - Reminders
- `knowledge.json` - Knowledge base articles
- `documents.json` - Document references
- `feedback.json` - User feedback
- `team.json` - Team member configuration
- `task_templates.json` - Task templates

**Backup Strategy:** Admin can download any data type as JSON from the Database Viewer.
